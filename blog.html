<p>It makes me really nervous because they can take over all the jobs because everyday humans invent and invent more robots 
to make our daily life more easy aand some of them are taking over jobs and making people loose their jobs because there are not necessary 
anymore </p>

<p>I worked really well with the girls we worked as a team and it was fun making the LED turn with my parteners
 i really enjoyed working with them. </p>
